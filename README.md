# Running-Back-Data
Creates models to best predict whether a Running Back will be a top performer in Fantasy Football. For my testing, I used three different models to help predict top running back performers;Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and a Nueral Netwrok. My analysis showed that the Random Forest was the best model for this data by performing over 97% accuracy on the data.
